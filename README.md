Generates a chart and exports the chart data of mai-tools Rating Analyzer

## Usage
1. Add `mai-chart-chart.js` into your favourite userscript manager
2. Press the 'mai chart chart' button at the top of the page when you reach mai-tools Rating Analyzer
3. Profit! The graph is shown
4. (optional) Copy the data to Microsoft Excel for comparison with your üõêfriends

(Tap anywhere to close)

## Result
It'll pop up a chart like this. 

Again, no real data is shown, since I suck at maimai
